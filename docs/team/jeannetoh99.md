### Project: Wanderlust

WanderLust is a desktop travel-planning application that allows users to plan their trips in a structured and efficient manner.
It is optimised for CLI-proficient users, and comes with a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has approximately 16 kLOC.

This application is part of my team project for an Introduction to Software Engineering (CS2103) module taken at NUS.

### Summary of Contributions

* Code contributed: [RepoSense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=jeannetoh99)

* **Major Enhancements**:
    - Implemented **UI**
        - What it does: The UI is the main interface that interacts with the user. It listens to user interaction,
            executes user commands using the `Logic` component and observes changes to data in `Model`, updating
            accordingly. The UI shows the user's list of travel plans on the left, and relevant activities, accommodations
            and friends on the right in different tabs. It also consists of help and exit menu buttons on the top, as
            well as command box, result display and status bar footer at the bottom.
        - Justifications: Although the application is mainly CLI based, the UI provides a clean and easy-to-read interface
            that allows the user to easily view and manage their travel plans. Nevertheless, the command box remains
            CLI-based and hence is still best-suited for CLI-proficient users.
        - Highlights:
            - This enhancement requires in-depth knowledge of the entire architecture, especially the `Logic` and `Model` components.
            Thus, in doing the UI, I also added and updated methods across `Logic`, `Model`, and `MainApp`, to ensure that
            the entire application functions as expected.
            - As the overall in-charge of Ui, I had to deeply understand its mechanisms and taught my teammates how it worked/ how they
            can update it if they need to.
            - Working with 3 different types of `TravelPlanObject`s -- `Activity`, `Accommodation` and `Friend` proved to be much more difficult
            than handling only 1 type (as in AB3), since use of JavaFX `ListView` does not take in wildcard types (e.g. `? extends TravelPlanObject`).
            Thus, a lot of experimentation and refactoring was required to find the ideal way to display the 3 types of `TravelPlanObjects`. 
            Ultimately, tab panes were introduced to display the 3 types of `TravelPlanObjects`.
            - Implemented the overall layout of the UI to meet the application's needs, and updated its styling from DarkTheme to BlueTheme.
            - Implemented auto-tabbing feature, where application automatically changes to the correct tab when specific commands are called.

            [\#286](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/286)

    - Implemented **Directory and ObservableDirectory**
        - What it does: `Directory` is an abstract class inherited by `TravelPlan` and `Wishlist`. This abstraction facilitates
        the implementation of the navigation feature, as well as the UI, in displaying the current directory. `ObservableDirectory`
        observes the current directory, and is observed by the UI so that the UI updates accordingly.
        - Relevant pull requests: ([\#86](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/86), [\#110](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/110))

    - Add **TravelPlan and Wishlist Packages** in model
        - What it does: Each `TravelPlan` act as a wrapper for its list of activities, accommodations and friends.
        Simultaneously, `TravelPlan` is also an object with its own name, start date and end date. There can be multiple copies
        of a `TravelPlan` within the `TravelPlanner`, each a unique object managing its own set of data, and being managed
        by the `TravelPlanner`. `Wishlist` is similar to `TravelPlan` except there is only 1 in the entire TravelPlanner,
        and it contains only a list of activities. It is used as a place to 'save' activities for future travels.
